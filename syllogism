    <h1>Syllogisms: Explanation and Examples</h1>
    <p>Syllogisms test logical reasoning by presenting statements (premises) and asking you to deduce valid conclusions. Below are the types of syllogisms with explanations and examples.</p>

    <h2>1. Universal Affirmative (All A are B)</h2>
    <p>This statement means that every element of A is also an element of B. However, not all B need to be A.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Statements:</strong> <br>
        1. All dogs are animals. <br>
        2. All animals are living beings. <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusions:</strong> <br>
        1. All dogs are living beings. (True) <br>
        2. All living beings are dogs. (False)
    </div>

    <h2>2. Universal Negative (No A is B)</h2>
    <p>This statement means that no element of A shares any relationship with B.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Statements:</strong> <br>
        1. No cat is a dog. <br>
        2. All dogs are animals. <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusions:</strong> <br>
        1. No cat is an animal. (False) <br>
        2. Some animals are not cats. (True)
    </div>

    <h2>3. Particular Affirmative (Some A are B)</h2>
    <p>This statement means that at least one element of A is also an element of B.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Statements:</strong> <br>
        1. Some flowers are roses. <br>
        2. All roses are red. <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusions:</strong> <br>
        1. Some flowers are red. (True) <br>
        2. All flowers are red. (False)
    </div>

    <h2>4. Particular Negative (Some A are not B)</h2>
    <p>This statement means that at least one element of A is definitely not an element of B.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Statements:</strong> <br>
        1. Some fruits are apples. <br>
        2. Some fruits are not oranges. <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusions:</strong> <br>
        1. Some apples are not oranges. (True) <br>
        2. All fruits are oranges. (False)
    </div>

    <h2>5. Mixed Statements</h2>
    <p>These involve a combination of universal and particular statements.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Statements:</strong> <br>
        1. All books are papers. <br>
        2. Some papers are journals. <br><br>
        <strong>Conclusions:</strong> <br>
        1. Some books are journals. (False) <br>
        2. Some journals are papers. (True)
    </div>
